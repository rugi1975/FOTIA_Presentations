\begin{frame}{• Surface Phenomena(Contd. )}

\begin{enumerate}
\item DIFFUSION can occur in presence of concentration gradients in the gases dissolved in solids. Temperature dependent process.

\item PERMEATION can occur by gas transfer from the outside atmosphere through the wall into vacuum space through diffusion process. Temperature dependent process. Significant amount of helium can permeate through glass walls into vacuum.

\item SORPTION If a material traps the air molecules in its surface then the  process is called sorption.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{• Surface Phenomena(Contd. )}

Adsorption is a process in which molecules are attracted to and become attached to the surface of a solid, resulting in a layer of adsorbed gas being few molecules thick.\\
Adsorption is an attractive force, hence generates heat.\\
Two types of Adsorption:\\



	


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{• Ways of Desorption }

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Thermal Desorption:} If external thermal energy is added in the system desorption takes place.
\item \textbf{Electron induced De Sorption :}  Electron energy should be greater than  5 ev.
 \item \textbf{Ion induced De Sorption:} Dependent on the energy of the ion. In untreated surface ion discharge cleaning is used to reduce out gassing rate.
 \item \textbf{Photon induced De Sorption :} It is a two step process. Photon produces a photo  electron which actually causes De Sorption.



\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{• Thermal Desorption or Baking }
If temperature increases then thermal de sorption takes place. If this is done intentionally then it is called baking.

\begin{frame}{• Ionization}

\begin{enumerate}
		\item Process of formation of Positive or Negative Ions and Free Electrons is called Ionization
\item An atom that loses a single electron is a singly charged Positive Ion
\item An atom that loses multiple electrons is a multiply charged Positive Ion
\item An atom that that is attached with a single electron is a Negative Ion
\item \textbf{Ionization can occur due to charged particle impact, Heat, Radiation.}

		
\end{enumerate}

		


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{• Electron Impact Ionization}

\begin{enumerate}
		\item Electric field $ E = \frac{V}{d}$ .
\item If electron travels a distance $\lambda_{e} $  before colliding with a gas atom/molecule (mean free path, ~ 0.5x10-6 m in atmospheric air), it will gain an energy   $ \frac{U \lambda_{e}}{d} = E \lambda_{e} $
\item The minimum energy to remove the weakest bound electron from its normal state in the neutral atom to a distance beyond its sphere of influence is the Ionization Energy
\item Mean free path for electrons is : $ \lambda_{e} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\lambda_{g}} $  and MFP for ions is : $ \lambda_{i} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\lambda_{g}} $ 
where $ \lambda_{g} $  is mean free path for gas 

\item Ionization efficiency of Electron
       \begin{itemize}
        \item This is number of ions produced per unit distance per unit gas pressure

        \item This is a function of electron energy

       
        \item The efficiency is maximum at electron energy of about 100 eV for most of the gases

\begin{frame}{• Vacuum Establishment}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Removal of gas molecules do not happen automatically. To establish vacuum molecules are pumped out of the vacuum system.
\item A vacuum pump is a device which removes gas molecules from the vacuum chamber. 
\item Removal of the gas molecules are done by 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Driving out molecules from the system.
 \item Absorbing molecules in a trap.
 \item Chemically changing the molecules.
\end{itemize}
 
\item Based on these principles different types of vacuum pumps are built.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{• Gas Flow}

\begin{enumerate}

\item While pumping down from atmosphere, the gas in the system goes through various flow regimes. These regimes depend on the size of vacuum components, the gas species and the temperature.
\item Knudsen Number ($k_{n}$) is dimensionless quantity defined as:         
\begin{center}

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

 $\lambda$ = mean free path ,  d = Dimension of Vessel

\item Type of flow is defined by $k_{n}$
   \begin{itemize}
   \item When $k_{n}< 0.1$ flow is Viscous.
   \item When $ 1>k_{n}> 0.01 $ flow is Transition.
   \item When $ k_{n}> 1.0 $ flow is Molecular.
   \end{itemize}
   

\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{• Viscous Flow}

Viscous Flow: “mob mentality”






\begin{enumerate}
\item Viscous Flow is like "Mob Mentality"
	\begin{itemize}
	\item  The type of gas flow that occurs when gas molecules are so close together that there are constant collisions.
	\item  Momentum transfer between the gas molecules.
    \item  Mean free path is relatively short
    \item  Gas flows like a liquid from high pressure to lower pressure
    \item  Gas flows like a liquid from high pressure to lower pressure
    \item  Predominantly in the rough vacuum regime

	\end{itemize}
	


\end{enumerate}

		


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{• Gas Flow Regimes}

Vacuum hardware selection is dependent on flow regime.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Viscous Flow
	\begin{itemize}
	\item  displacement pumps:  rotary vane, roots, diaphragm
	\item  direct pressure gauges:  manometers, bourdon tubes
    \item  elastomer seals
    \item  less limited by the conductance of the system

	\end{itemize}
	

\item Molecular Flow

    \begin{itemize}
	\item  momentum transfer or entrapment pumps:  turbo, ion, cryo
	\item  indirect pressure gauges:  ion gauges
    \item  metal seals
    \item  VERY limited by the conductance of the system

	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{• Paschen's Law}


Paschen's Law reflects the Townsend breakdown mechanism in gases, that is, a cascading of secondary electrons emitted by collisions in the gap.
Electrical breakdown characteristics of a gap are a function (generally not linear) of the product of the gas pressure and the gap length, usually written as, $ V = f(P.d) $
where P is the pressure and d is the gap distance. 
In reality, the pressure should be replaced by the gas density.\\

For air, and gaps on the order of a millimeter, the breakdown is roughly a linear function of the gap length: 
$ V = 30 P d + 1.35 kV $
where d is in centimeters, and p is in atmospheres.
